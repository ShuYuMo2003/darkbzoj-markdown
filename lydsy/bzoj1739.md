# [Usaco2005 mar]Space Elevator 太空电梯 - 题目 - Universal Online Judge

## Description: 

The cows are going to space! They plan to achieve orbit by building a sort of space elevator: a giant tower of blocks. They have K (1 <= K <= 400) different types of blocks with which to build the tower. Each block of type i has height h_i (1 <= h_i <= 100) and is available in quantity c_i (1 <= c_i <= 10). Due to possible damage caused by cosmic rays, no part of a block of type i can exceed a maximum altitude a_i (1 <= a_i <= 40000). Help the cows build the tallest space elevator possible by stacking blocks on top of each other according to the rules. 

### Input: 

* Line 1: A single integer, K * Lines 2..K+1: Each line contains three space-separated integers: h_i, a_i, and c_i. Line i+1 describes block type i.

### Output: 

* Line 1: A single integer H, the maximum height of a tower that can be built


## Sample Input: 
```
3
7 40 3
5 23 8
2 52 6


```

## Sample Output: 
```
48
从底部开始，先放3个方块2，之后3个方块1，接下来6个方块3．不能把3个方块1堆到4个方
块2上，因为这样最高的方块1的顶部高度超过了40.
