Q: Where are the input and the output? A: Your program shall always read input from stdin (Standard Input) and write output to stdout (Standard Output). For example, you can use 'scanf' in C or 'cin' in C++ to read from stdin, and use 'printf' in C or 'cout' in C++ to write to stdout. You shall not output any extra data to standard output other than that required by the problem, otherwise you will get a "Wrong Answer". User programs are not allowed to open and read from/write to files. You will get a "Runtime Error" or a "Wrong Answer" if you try to do so. Here is a sample solution for problem 1000 using C++/G++:

It's important that the return type of main() must be int when you use G++/GCC,or you may get compile error. Here is a sample solution for problem 1000 using C/GCC:

Here is a sample solution for problem 1000 using PASCAL:

Here is a sample solution for problem 1000 using JAVA: Now java compiler is jdk 1.5, next is program for 1000

Old program for jdk 1.4
