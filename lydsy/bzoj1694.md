19

INPUT DETAILS:

Four clumps: at 1, 9, 11, and 19. Bessie starts at location 10.

```

## Sample Output: 
```

44

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie can follow this route:

* start at position 10 at time 0
* move to position 9, arriving at time 1
* move to position 11, arriving at time 3
* move to position 19, arriving at time 11
* move to position 1, arriving at time 29

giving her a total staleness of 1+3+11+29 = 44.  There are other routes
with the same total staleness, but no route with a smaller one.
